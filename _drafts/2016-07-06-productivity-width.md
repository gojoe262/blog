There seems to be two dimensions in which to measure productivity: depth and width.

Productivity in depth usually happens when you have a repeatable process (e.g. creating x number of widgets). You are measured by how many things you completed in a given amount of time, (i.e. the speed of the task). This type of measurement is very common in manufacturing.

Productivity in width is when each task you do is unique. You are not truly measured by the speed of the task. Instead you are measured by how many different tasks you completed. This is more common in the creative world.

Now how does depth/width tie into momentum, and by momentum I mean how easily can your concentration be broken?

When a job is measured  by depth, it tends to have a lot of momentum. By repeating the task multiple times, you develop a groove. Things become almost automatic. If you are interrupted, you can easily jump back into the groove.  

On the other hand, when a job is measured by width, momentum is low. Each task you are working on is unique, so there is a lot of temporary information stored in your short term memory. When you are interrupted, that fragile structure built in your short term memory falls apart. It is hard to jump back into it.
