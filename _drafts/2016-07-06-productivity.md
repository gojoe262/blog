Through my experience in working in manufacturing and software development, I've came to the conclusion that there are two dimensions in which to measure productivity: **depth and width**.

**Productivity in depth** usually happens when you have a repeatable process (e.g. creating x number of widgets). You are measured by how many things you completed in a given amount of time, (i.e. the speed of the task). This type of measurement is very common in manufacturing.

For example, in my manufacturing job, I recorded the number of parts completed and the time taken to complete them. This data would be entered into the job tracking system. I'm sure this data all fed into some neatly laid-out report which measured the shop's productivity.

**Productivity in width** happens when each task you do is unique. You are not measured by the speed of the task but instead by the quality of the task. This is more common in the business and creative world.

Through my work in software development, we would keep data on the number of bugs found/fixed and the number of support calls received/resolved. This was all in an effort to improve the quality of the software we were creating.





Now how does depth/width tie into momentum? And by momentum, I mean how easily can your concentration be broken?

When a job is measured  by depth, it tends to have a lot of momentum. By repeating the task multiple times, you develop a groove. Things become almost automatic. If you are interrupted, you can easily jump back into the groove.  

On the other hand, when a job is measured by width, momentum is low. Each task you are working on is unique, so there is a lot of temporary information stored in your short term memory. When you are interrupted, that fragile structure built in your short term memory falls apart. It is hard to jump back into it.
